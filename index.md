# My Workflow

A couple of times lately someone has said "Wow, what did you just do?!?" because I used a tool or shortcut to do something quickly. I also often see people doing something in a YouTube video or while watching them work and try to learn it so that I can work faster. This site will be a collection of tricks I've accumulated both for myself and also for anyone else who cares.

Skip all this

## Apps that make life better (on OSX)

* [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) - Get control over your windows
* [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) - Better than OSX terminal
* [PageKite](http://pagekite.net/) - Serve anything on your localhost to a real web address (good for showing clients things)
* [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - Alfred saves you time when you search for files online or on your Mac. Be more productive with hotkeys, keywords and file actions at your fingertips.

## Gems I love


## Homebrews I use

* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) - Terminal multiplexer. Keep all my terminal work organized into panes, pages and sessions

## Vim

* [My.vimrc file](https://github.com/MattReimer/my-workflow/blob/master/vim/.vimrc)

## Sublime

* [Markdown Preview](sublime/md-preview.html)

## Alfred Workflows

* [Toggle hidden files](https://github.com/MattReimer/my-workflow/raw/master/alfred/Toggle%20hidden%20files.alfredworkflow) - Actually written by Chris Torglason
* [Eject all](http://alfredtips.tumblr.com/post/3422385132/the-one-in-which-you-want-to-eject-all-with)
